# Eco Routes SDK Demo
This is a [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-rainbowkit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/packages/create-rainbowkit).

Reference this project if you are integrating the Eco Routes SDK into your project. This project demonstrates how to use the Eco Routes SDK to generate, publish and track an intent to fulfillment.

This project uses [viem](https://viem.sh).

## Getting Started
First, install dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

Add the appropriate environment variables to a `.env.local` file in the root of the demo directory. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
